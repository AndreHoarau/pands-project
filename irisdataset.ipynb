    "The Iris data set is a famous data set compiled by R.A. Fisher of Cambridge University. It is commonly used as part of statistics and machine learning exercises. The data set consists of 50 instances of 3 classes of iris plants. The sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width of each of the species of Setosa, Versicolour and Virginica are measured.\n",
    "The dataset was published by the Ronald Fisher in 1936 paper \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems.\"\n",
    "The data set is in a CSV (Comma seperated value) format\n",
    "Note: I modified the Iris Data set before beggining to work on it. I added sepal_length,sepal_width,petal_length,petal_width,species as a line in order to give the csv rows headers."

They allow for a visual representation of where most of the data in a set exists or what the distribution of a set of data looks like. The histograms are of each variable across the 3 species resulting in 4 plots one for each variable and using different colours and a legend to specify between the species of flowers. \n",

There appears to be a rather strong correlation between petal length and width within all the species. If we were to perform a linear regression on these scatter plots the pearson coefficient for this graph would be quite close to 1. This would mean in theory that based on the petal width of a flower one could predict the width and vice versa.\n",

    "Other observations include: \n",
    "* All the plots are quite distinct in their groupings of species but once again it appears that the setosa is least like the other 2 species. \n",
