# Programming and Scripting Project

Project Aim: This project aims to investigate the [Fisher's Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris). 
This repository contains:
* This README introducing the repository.
* Jupyter notebook in which there is longer form text of the data set itself and of my comments of my analysis along with all references used.
* A python script that end users can run that will output relevant data analysis visualisations and enable for an end user to enter in sepal and petal lengths and widths and be told with a percentage certainty what species of flower this is most likely.

Overall this project should exhibit my learning throughout this course whilst also mimicking a real life scenario in the workplace.


## Technologies
* Python 3.11.5 available [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
* Visual Studio Code available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Note: Installation instructions are included at both addresses.


## How to run this repository:
Download the file onto your local machine and using Visual studio code open the file folder.
In the terminal run $python .\analysis.py
The script will generate a txt file and png file. All corresponding comments on these will be contained within irisdataset.ipynb
The histograms, scatter plots and heat maps will pop up on screen to progress with the script close the windows of these images.
The jupyter notebook should be rendered and viewable in Github but if you want to see it on visual studio code click on the run all button and ensure to select tha anaconda python kernel.
