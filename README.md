# pands-project
Plan for the project is as follows:
Due Date May 20th
Week 1 starting 11/03/24: Set up repository and make plan (Note I am a little late on this week as playing catch up from life)
Week 2 Starting 18/03/24: Import data set and elaborate on plan based off of this week's lectures. Research data analysis that have been done.
Week 3 Starting 25/03/24: Start to get hands dirty with working on analysis. Do some basic analysis maybe us pands means averages comparing 3 types of flowers. Make Histograms of the 3 flower species outlining their distributions of each variable
Week 4 Starting 01/05/24: Start to make plots using matplot lib etc. Write in readme or jupyter about the initial analysis from last week.
Week 5 Starting 08/05/24: Elaborate on plots make it look nicer. Write explanations and findings from the previous week. 
Week 6 Starting 15/05/24: Finalise details and submit.


Note: I modified the Iris Data set before beggining to work on it. I added sepal_length,sepal_width,petal_length,petal_width,species as a line in order to give the csv rows headers.
Summary of the Iris Data Set:
This is a multivariate dataset consisting of 150 entires. The entries are composed of 5 attributes 4 measurements and one class and species of the flower type.
The 4 measurements include:
Sepal length cm
Sepal width cm 
Petal length in cm 
Petal width in cm
The Class of all the Iris are Iris with the 3 species being either Setosa, Versicolor or Virginica
There are 50 entries of each plant species in the data set.
The dataset was published by the Ronald Fisher in 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems."
This is a classic data set used in statistics and machine learning.
The data set is in a CSV (Comma seperated value) format

Ideas: Andre to decsribe what petals and sepals are maybe include some images from web in Jupyter Notebook to give some context include images of the different types.
