# pands-project
Plan for the project is as follows:
Due Date May 20th
Week 1 starting 11/03/24: Set up repository and make plan (Note I am a little late on this week as playing catch up from life)
Week 2 Starting 18/03/24: Import data set and elaborate on plan based off of this week's lectures. Research data analysis that have been done.
Week 3 Starting 25/03/24: Start to get hands dirty with working on analysis. Do some basic analysis maybe us pands means averages comparing 3 types of flowers. Make Histograms of the 3 flower species outlining their distributions of each variable
Week 4 Starting 01/05/24: Start to make plots using matplot lib etc. Write in readme or jupyter about the initial analysis from last week.
Week 5 Starting 08/05/24: Elaborate on plots make it look nicer. Write explanations and findings from the previous week. 
Week 6 Starting 15/05/24: Finalise details and submit.


Note: I modified the Iris Data set before beggining to work on it. I added sepal_length,sepal_width,petal_length,petal_width,species as a line in order to give the csv rows headers.
Summary of the Iris Data Set:
This is a multivariate dataset consisting of 150 entires. The entries are composed of 5 attributes 4 measurements and one class and species of the flower type.
The 4 measurements include:
Sepal length cm
Sepal width cm 
Petal length in cm 
Petal width in cm
The Class of all the Iris are Iris with the 3 species being either Setosa, Versicolor or Virginica
There are 50 entries of each plant species in the data set.
The dataset was published by the Ronald Fisher in 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems."
This is a classic data set used in statistics and machine learning.
The data set is in a CSV (Comma seperated value) format

Ideas: Andre to decsribe what petals and sepals are maybe include some images from web in Jupyter Notebook to give some context include images of the different types. 

# Programming and Scripting Project
## Lecturer: Andrew Beatty (andrew.beatty@atu.ie)
**By Andre Hoarau**

Project Aim: This project aims to investigate the [Fisher's Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris). 
This repository contains:
* This README introducing the repository.
* Jupyter notebook in which there is longer form text of the data set itself and of my comments of my analysis.
* A python script that end users can run that will output relevant data analysis visualisations and enable for an end user to enter in sepal and petal lengths and widths and be told with a percentage certainty what species of flower this is most likely.
Overall this project should exhibit my learning throughout this course whilst also mimicking a real life scenario in the workplace.


## Technologies
* Python 3.11.5 available [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
* Visual Studio Code available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Note: Installation instructions are included at both addresses.


## How to run the notebook:
Download the file onto your local machine and using Visual studio code open the file folder.
In the terminal run $python .\analysis.py
